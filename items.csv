"We're a long term business client accepting payments via Stripe. The customer service is very easy to contact but the responses are often sub-par. One representative will understand your request, they'll transfer you to a colleague, you'll need to repeat everything all over again, the new person won't read the notes and they'll refer you to a support article that isn't relevant at all. It's a lot of time wasted and it feels like going in circles.",2024-09-20T10:47:11.000Z,2024-09-20T10:58:04.000Z,"September 20, 2024",Peter A,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Hi Peter, thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback with us.

"It interesting to note that there is no connected phone number, email or ANY means of connecting with Stripe about their fraudulent merchant processing. Their customer (Saman) used a web redirect to get a fraudulent collector coin order (for $133). In other words, it was a different company all the way until the order placement screen and the fact that it was Saman was disguised thru a last minute redirect. Saman sends an unbelievable amount of emails, but offers no response. They have a phony tracking number for your order and their phone has been disconnected. What sort of background check does Stripe do on their merchants? So, Saman operates out of an empty 750 sq ft Condo in Brooklyn, has no store front (Straw Man operation) and does not respond to emails once they have your money. This must be why Stripe does no background check on their merchants for processing - Saman is a foreign national from England so this has to be taken up with the State Department and District Attorney's office. Evidently, a BBB complaint must be filed and this is now a federal matter concerning the FTC and the FBI (it's across state lines) and the Secretary of State. Hope Stripe enjoys all the attention. Was it worth it to Stripe to collect that $4 processing fee?

Initially, contacting their customer service was straightforward, but the response times were often excessively long.

Stripe deducted fees from both the client's transaction and our account, resulting in our account going negative.

"I wish I could give 0 stars because It does not deserve any good reviews. I opened up an account with them after opening an account with FreshBooks. Freshbooks had recommended Stripe as a payment platform so I decided to go ahead and get set up with them. I made an account with stripe and the first few small payments of $290-$375 went fine. No problems, but then I had a customer make a payment for $1,755 and that’s when It all went terribly wrong. They stated my business was a “high risk” and stated that they were withholding the funds until I could provided further documentation that the company was a legitimate business. Which I then did so. I provided legal documentation including the certificate of formation. At first they had accepted It and within minutes they denied It. I tried to send more information including business bank statements which they also asked for but they would not allow me to prove that my business was legit anymore. This happened nearly a month ago. They still have not given the money to me nor have their refunded It to my customer like they stated that they were going to in their email. They said It would take roughly 5 business days. They also took $ 618.33 out of the payment that was made by my customer which was $1,755 for so called “fees” which they also would not explain what the fees were for. I tried calling and emailing. The email responses are a joke and do not provide very much information. Then when you call all they tell you and will tell you is It is being put under investigation to see what happened. Which by the way it’s nearly impossible to get ahold of them by phone. I still have not received a response from the last time I emailed. They really should be shut down and Google should absolutely not recommend this company. Freshbooks/Stripewas one of their top rated small business invoice platforms.

They make it extremely difficult to do anything with them, you can't even pick up the phone and actually get ahold of some. No, instead you have to go online, talk with an AI generated chat, have to explain what the issue is to a COMPUTER, and then sit and wait for them to call you back. They are not transparent about the initial set-up process, they hide the important information in the back of the website with ""fine print"" then act like they're the victim when your upset.

"There were no issues with Stripe for a couple of years, however once I wasn't comfortable providing what Stripe wanted, there was no recourse. The illusion Stripe offers real support is positive for their public image, however after dealing with an issue for several weeks, I have concluded the support team doesn't have the authority to make decisions, they only enforce the corporate line. I suspect after communicating with 10+ support staff, that Stripe has created standardized scripts for dealing with complaints. All email replies I received, shared a similar tone and structure, parroted company policy, and offered supporting document links for me to read, on my time.  Stripe support team suggests they care, are willing to listen, and invite me to email again if I have additional questions, but from my experience support staff don't have the authority to resolve a client's issue.

All my July payments from clients have been held in the Stripe account. The staff cannot resolve this issue and do not know what to do.

"The worst company for your business. Especially if you have a business that might have a high number in refunds for the customers. Stripe charges you fees for every transaction. When you send refunds back to the customer they keep their original fee charged. On top of that they 1st send you an email stating they are going to hold 25% of your money coming in due to being high risk (due to the refunds). Then in 24 hours you receive an email that your account is completely cancelled and you have no access to all of your funds. When you try to call and get clarification, you are on hold for 30 mins before someone answers and is too incompetent to provide you with any answers. And all they repeatedly kept saying is that this number is for general questions and they don’t have any other phone numbers for clients to contact for help. I would need to send an email and wait 24-48 hours to get a response to when I will receive all of my money and how do I continue to take care of my customers needs with a canceled account. Where is my customers money going??!! This is so frustrating.

"I run a small marketing and technology firm that helps generate leads for the financial space.  I have been using Stripe without any issues for several years until I took on an Merchant Cash Advance company.  I spent over 200 hours to build a lead generating machine so they can get clients. We generated over 650 prospects over the course of several months.  We had met all milestones that were required by client.  After 5 and a half months, this MCA company has decided to claim a Fraudulent Chargeback even though all agreements specifically has stated there are no refunds for builds.  Without any hesitation Stripe has decided in the favor of the client and tried to take $15,500 from my bank account.  I had also given a 25 page document with screenshots of all work that was provided, yet Stripe and the merchant had sided with the MCA company. To make things worse, I had another payment made by a client that they froze and did not release to me because of an ongoing dispute.  I had tried to refund this back to my client with no luck.  Stripe simply froze my accounts and literally stole another $1545.00 payment from me and claims that I also owe this money which I never received.  They are robbing people blind with no accountability.  I plan to start a Class Action lawsuit against them, because based on all the blogs and Forums there are countless of businesses that are falling victim to Stripes abuses.  There is no customer support, and they only communicate through email with canned responses. I will be reaching out to the Attorney General as there is need to be an audit of Stripe's practices, there are many documented cases of Stripe freezing hundreds of accounts in the 6 figures range.  I wonder how much money Stripe is withholding from small businesses illegally.  PS, when speaking with the MCA's credit card company American Express, they state that it is Stripe that allowed the Chargeback and Stripe claims that they are only a Portal (this is a false claim). The dispute was in favor of the unscrupulous MCA company because they held a Black American Express card, which allows their clients to do a charge back with no limit of time. Stripe should have policies in place that has time limits for chargebacks, otherwise, beware you could get robbed years later with no recourse.  I plan to fight this in court with all parties involved. I have all my emails that proves Stripe has Zero customer support.  As soon as there are any disputes, they take away your ability to have a phone call with customer support and you can only communicate with emails.  They hide behind emails and no one will reach to you to try and help you resolve your claim.  If you are lucky, you will only be able to speak with a representative over seas, specifically the Philippines, but they have no ability to help whatsoever, waste of time. There job is to forward your complaint via email which leads nowhere.  Beware, use your own bank's merchant services if they offer it.  I have spoken to hundreds of companies that have had similar nightmare situations with Stripe and no recourse.  I would give Zero Stars if that would've been an option.",2024-07-07T00:03:34.000Z,2024-07-07T00:16:11.000Z,"May 30, 2024",Albert Aulov,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Hi Albert, thank you for sharing your feedback with us.

"This is my second time writing review for stripe, for my first review I have written that they close my account and stripe send me a follow up email asking me to email heretohelp at stripe.com so they can take a look at my account. GUYS, I can absolutely prove that there is 0 response and no even single response from Stripe after I email them several times about what is going on. At the end, they just simply close the account and refund all whatever payment out there. So second time, since stripe did receive many good feedback around my network, I consult with a Sales / Growth from Stripe Singapore. I have done phone call, checking with him every single thing I could miss, and even asking him to check if there is  anything wrong or if I am not violating anything.

Unfortunately, Stripe doesn't have the authority to create refunds on behalf of our users. To get a refund, we'd recommend reaching out to the business directly, as it's the most effective way to solve any disagreements.

"Worst payment provider. We are an honest company and provide our services to our clients honestly. We are a marketing agency and started working with Stripe to accept payments from clients. I had previously read bad reviews about stripe, but we still decided to try working with them. From the very beginning of working with Stripe, we connected a third-party company to prevent chargebacks so that Stripe would not block us. Everything was great at the beginning and we accepted about 100 payments and in one day we received 2 chargebacks for the RDR visa and these 2 payments were immediately returned to the clients' accounts, since we used a third-party provider to prevent chargebacks. It is worth noting that one chargeback was made by the client by mistake, the second chargeback was actually made by the client and these payments were immediately returned to the clients’ account via RDR. Stripe support assured us that if we use a third-party company to prevent chargebacks, our account will not be blocked. Moreover, our chargeback rate was 0%. Despite our best efforts, our account was blocked. We tried to prove that we did not break the rules and provided all the evidence that we prevent chargebacks, that our chargeback rating is 0% and that one chargeback was made by a client by mistake, but none of this helped. Now our account is blocked by mistake and support does not want to help us, moreover, now we have to wait 120 days to withdraw more than $8,000 from our Stripe account.

"Those b*stards took everything. I sell gift cards from different services and I sold through Stripe. I've gotten no disputes. I spent 100 dollars to buy gift cards and got profited about 200-300 dollars. Not even a month later they blocked my account because it's “high risk”.

"I tried opening a Stripe account while I was visiting my daughter in France because I could not use my bank-issued credit card system there. I did not pass the verification process because I was not willing to turn over an extensive amount of financial documents  to them. I processed through them five credit card payments from my patients.  When my account was closed they refunded four of the five payments to the original cards but did not refund one which totaled $1100.  I check everyday and the payout date keeps getting pushed out. According to them they are delaying this “due to high likelihood of fraudulent dispute”. But after a month there has been no dispute whatsoever and they are just holding onto the money.  In fact,when I ran that card on 4/5/2024 the risk assessment was “normal”.  I cannot believe they can legally  keep payments for indefinite periods of time when the payment has gone through and is sitting in their account.  If that charge was fraudulent it would have been disputed by now.   I am still in France but when I get back to California I am going to contact the California Attorney General’s Office and get some clarification about this.

Despite reaching out to them multiple times, their customer service has been unhelpful. If you're a small business like us, save yourself the hassle and explore other credit card processing options.

"Why are most of the good review of Stripe ""invited?"" Stripe has illegally withheld monies from my small business for several months now. They change their reason why and keep delaying the release thereof. I have no chargebacks, no refunds, no complaints. You can't call them, and countless emails to them either go unanswered, or they respond with a generic reply that ""they are investigating"" or ""they will get back to you"" by a certain date, only to extend the date they will get back to you. I suspect they do this, to use their small business merchant's capital for free (think of it, using millions of dollars interest fee-especially during inflation). They will inform you, the merchant is in breach, but actually I feel it is Stripe in breach.

We understand that you’re concerned about a refund that you’ve requested from a merchant that is using Stripe. Refunds typically take 5–10 business days to process; your funds may be on their way to you currently. If you haven't received your refund after 10 business days, please check with the business to get a proof of refund and reach out to your bank. It's likely you will need to speak to the Treasury Department of your bank to understand where your refund is. If the merchant is experiencing errors in processing the refund, please let them contact us. Otherwise, the best and quickest way for you to receive your funds back is to get in touch with your bank and file a dispute against them. Please note that the outcome of a dispute is decided entirely by your bank. To inquire about the status or outcome of a dispute, you will need to contact your bank.

But for the products i have shipped there is still an amount which stripe has to pay me out.

"After a few weeks of using my Stripe account, they decided to ban my account because of ""fraudulent transaction"" they never gave me more information about this. They also told me that they will refund all the balance to the customers within 5 days. But they never refunded my customers !!! Now after waiting over 120 days, I am asking them to receive the remaining balance of the account. They answer is clearly saying that they will never send me the money. So what is the conclusion of this ? You can not get your money, and your customers can not get their money back. So who is keeping the money ?? Stripe !! For what reason ??? It's not theirs !!! This system is a complete fraud and I don't understand that a big company like this can still be to operate under such commercial practices. I can understand that they want to manage their risk of loss regarding the eventual chargebacks that can happen a few weeks after the purchase. So ok, keep my money for 120 days if you want, but send it to me at the end of the period instead of having such behavior. In addition, all their replies are made using automatic emails that still says that they will refund the charges but they won't !!! Their email has no sense but it clearly says that ""the remaining balance will not be made available to you"" !!!! Stripe if you read this, send me my money !!!

"Stripe has been awful.  I opened an account with them several years ago and because I didn't have a problem I never had to deal with their customer service.  It wasn't until I started having problems that stripe started to be horrible.  Their customer service is a total joke.  They are uneducated about their product and cannot answer questions.  My first issue was that I wanted to offer affirm, klarna, or after-pay to my international customers.  They kept telling me I could do this.  I worked on this for a week until I figured out on my own by reading through a million of their online help manuals that all of their customer service representatives were wrong.  Second, I opened up a new business in a different state so I opened a second stripe account.  That is when things have gotten really messy.  Stripe has held my funds twice when they decide they need additional information and when I provide them that information they take a week or more to approve it and hold my money the entire time.  Their customer service representatives do not know what they are doing or saying at all.  They can't speak English very well, put you on long holds, in the back ground it is noisy with loud breathing into the receiver.

"Horrible service, I’ve recently created an. account and made sales, then a fraudulent chargeback takes place from a risky profile, that created his account 2 minutes prior to purchasing, I wasn’t informed about the anti fraud feature at that time. Stripe immediately closed my account and threatened to refund everyone because my account is deemed ”too high risk”? how do you blame a new merchant of being ”too high risk” just for not having enough sales and not having everything verified for not knowing how it works? that defeats the entire point. not only that but they specifically mentioned that my other sales, that had 0 issues will NOT be made to me because of their ”tos”, they made a rule to rob you out of your money which is crazy, I asked for clarifications for my account closure, as a EU citizen they have to abide by p2b regulations, which stands for transparency between the seller and buyer, in which they completely ignored, ontop of that I warned the company to not issue any refund until further clarifications, which also got ignored and the fraudster got refunded. I’m pretty sure they’re robbing us. What bothers me is i’ve found out they’ve been constantly doing this and didn’t deal with any repercussions. However, i am optimistic that the EU won’t take this lightly, they’ve sued anything you can think of, which gave me the idea to inform my lawyer about taking this to the EU commission to see what can happen.

"Our flower business has been set on ‘pause’ because of being placed on the restricted list while there was just a misunderstanding with the Ukraine regions. Officially Luhansk / donetsk are just Ukraine but according stripe they aren’t anymore. Or at high risk. Even though we fixed all issues there’s nobody that respond on our emails and or there’s also not a proffesional business account manager that we can call with. Stripe seems just simply not care about their business owners and expect that you wait for weeks on an email from their side. Unbelievable dissapointed in Stripe. My first review was from 22 march but It’s now today 5 april and so 2 weeks later and still none response from stripe and they hold / freeze € 1460 euro from my clients in their pockets. They promise in the app to make the pay out but every time delay and delay. This shows the real face of stripe. That they steal from the hard working companies, that done all the needed updates so far but Stripe doesn’t care and don’t show that they are professional payment processors.

Well I have been using stripe to process payments for my business for a year or so. There is no consistency to the timeframe in which they process payments.

Stripes phone support there with the worst of the worst. You will sit on hold for hours and hours only to have to hang up to love on with your life. Finding a way to contact support via email is next to impossible. No live chat option from what I can see.  No call back option which is what would make the most sense.

"Stripe too large and no longer value even mid-tier customers. Even when you are an enterprise customer with a contract, processing millions the level of support shown is poor. Live systems impacted by due diligence requirements despite having been through the full due diligence process with our other accounts. Due to a system bug a new account we setup couldn't be linked to our main legal entity. Despite weeks of chasing their support and our account manager no resolution to the issue and payments on a live site have now been paused costing us thousands and embarrassment with our partner. No reply from Stripe support all day and no extension / fast track of approval even after suppling all the required information and documents.

This was a test transaction (to test the tap-to-pay procedures), for $1, and using my own card (as a business owner). So, their flag was totally groundless and abusive. When I asked about the reasons why this transaction has been considered a fraud, they said ""we're not able to provide details as to which charges are considered unauthorized, and have no leeway regarding this restriction"".

These requirements come from our regulators and are intended to prevent abuse of the financial system.

RUN AWAY FROM STRIPE!!!!                  I opened a stripe account to enable credit card payments for my home remodeling business.  I had a customer make 3 credit card payments for nearly $8k.   Stripe took the payments then charged me the fees of almost $250.  I was then told by Stripe that I could never transfer these funds to my bank because my website was unable to be verified.  My company has no website and never has.  I contacted customer support that took literally an hour to speak to someone in India.  She simply said without a website or social media presence I would never be able to receive my funds.

"I opened a company in the UAE and started working with Stripe. Before that, I accepted payments either in cash or via bank transfer. However, as more clients requested card payments, I successfully went through all verification steps with Stripe and began accepting payments. After a month of using Stripe, I realized it's a company that deceives its customers and takes their money. I accepted payments from clients, one of whom was my aunt. Everything seemed fine, and Stripe was performing as expected. But one day, I received an order from a company to pay me $10,000 for services. I accepted the payment through Stripe, and a minute later, they blocked my account. When I inquired why, they claimed, ""the cardholder or bank requested a refund for a recently made payment."" I asked for proof and engaged in a lengthy battle with their support, refuting every claim they made against me and my company. After a long discussion, Stripe simply cut me off, citing my business as high-risk and stating they couldn't work with me. I asked about the money in my Stripe account at that time, expected on December 11. Two days after that email, half of the balance disappeared from my account. When I investigated, I found that Stripe autonomously returned the money to clients, deducting it from my account. Even my aunt was on the list of refunded clients. I'm in constant communication with all my clients due to the nature of my work, and none of them initiated or requested any refunds. You can't imagine how low these scammers at Stripe go; they take away people's hard-earned money. Moreover, they froze my account for 120 days, and there's still $7,000 remaining in it. I write to support every day, and I either receive no response or get generic replies. I wish I could share screenshots of my correspondence with these fraudulent individuals so you could see and understand that working with this company is impossible under any circumstances. They might tell you everything is fine and you can accept payments of any amount, but in reality, they deceive you and wait for you to deposit money there. Don't work with scammers and be extremely cautious when choosing such services.",2023-12-30T19:54:27.000Z,2023-12-22T20:04:02.000Z,"December 22, 2023",DM International,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Hey there, we're incredibly sorry the experience has been less than positive here and that's definitely not what we aim for.

"It was nice to be able to talk to a person rather than a chat bot. First to offer a balnced view you need to understand that working with stripe is new to me, so I have limited knowledge and am learning as I go. I explained my situation and asked how I fix it. You will have the details on your system. The lady was very polite and informed me that she would need a few mins to find a solution. We were cut off by the system and I did get a response by email however the time line did not meet my immediate needs. It resulted in me finding a different solution outside the stripe eco system. Nobodys fault just the way it happened. If I could offer some suggestions - if you included so sort of needs analysis when a client is seeking help it could help you match them up with the right level of knowledge resulting in a quicker turnaround for stripe and a greater satisfaction level with a client. It could be something as basic as ticking a box to show the clients level of expertise with stripe. Alternatively you should be able to work a formula out that shows how long a client has been registered with stripe, the amount and type of transactions would equate to a level of knowledge and therefore match with the appropriate level of knowledge in a customer service person. This is not a criticism of my customer service lady its just looking at the process.

"I have received my first sale through Stripe. I was lucky enough to get every sale through Paypal but finally I got stuck with a Stripe transaction and now the obstructions to handing over money begins. (No problems with Paypal. People pay and I can log on and transfer the money there and then if I so desire.) Apparently the number I have given them is incorrect is what the dashboard says. I queried that and received a phone call within hours (starfor that), they sent me an email telling me what I needed to provide (star for that), and this is where it gets typical American arrogance. ""I haven't provided them with my correct IRS number."" The funny thing about that is I am clearly in Australia as per my address and my website and I am not an American citizen. Having an IRS number would be a bigger concern than the fact that I don't have one. Just once, it would be nice to find an American company that recognizes a world outside of America. Au stands for Australia, not Austin, Texas. I am now awaiting their next obstacle to me receiving my money. Note to Americans, we don't pay taxes to the IRS outside of America if we arent American citizens.

"In September of 2021 Stripe found fraud of nearly 87K had occurred in our account, they professionally dealt with and marked it resolved as is their job for the ""Gold Standard"" of credit card processing.  On October 9th of 2023 we received a fraud text to the admin of the account. On October 17th admin was locked out of our account and Stripe notified our business of fraud shortly there after.  We immediately began to dispute and rectify this with stripe.  One transaction for $15,321 dollars fraudulently charged in this account.  Our stripe account had been hacked.  From 11/7/23 through 11/14/23 our case had been escalated dozens of times through supervisor after supervisor, each representative disclosed they would not take responsibility for the fraud.  On 11/9 Beverly from Stripe informed us she had ""re-enabled"" the security protection on our account that protects changing bank accounts for incoming deposits to require the old account number be ""typed"" in prior to replacing with an new account number, as the system will not show the old number.  When asked how this was disabled they had no response, but said it should be active as ""default"" on all accounts. Our obviously was not.  We requested limits and spending controls as our average sales are less than $100 each and certainly not tens of thousands at a time.  We were immediately told a specialist would contact us. This did not happen.  On 11/10 we submitted evidence on the $15,321 inquiry so that they could see clearly this was fraud.   On 11/14/23 Marie called from Stripe and said they would not cover any losses, nor could she answer any of our existing questions regarding limit controls or the default banking security breach.  She would also escalate the case to have the current balance reviewed and explained. We cannot get them to explain the dollars in our account that exceed what we are owed, but do not match the charges they say occurred. Noone would help us process payout for the dollars we were due and leave disputed dollars in the account for Stripe to resolve.  We do not want more than we are owed, simply what our actual customers have spent with us.   Yesterday at 1am on 11/19, they reported the customers bank has chosen a chargeback and leaving this balance on a small business to deal with.  We are now dealing with the police and the Federal Trade Commission.  Stripe has continuously put us on the back burner and refused to address many of our primary concerns.  The least of which is how are we responsible for a breach through a control for changing account numbers that cannot be activated or toggled by the admin of the account? This is purely a Stripe backend function.  Stripe is now holding a small business essentially hostage.

"I just want warn everyone, like so many have before about Stripe. They will really and openly steal your money! So we have a legitimate bussniess where we sell products, we signed up with Stripe (BIG MISSATKE) Orders started coming in and we shipped all order with tracking numbers, key word here is tracking numbers. Which shows all order recived, signed and delivered to all customers. First few payout from stripe worked fine, then when it came to 3 big payout from Stripe, they never arrived. They kept saying we should talk to our bank. We talked to our bank who said no money arrived and they cant trace any funds. It should be the sender bank who can trace it. We informed this to stripe, who kept replying we will get back to you as soon as possible to all of our emails. For weeks, while we had no funds or payment. Then when they replied, same story.. they replied talk to your bank! Finally i had enough and asked my bank for statement letter which says no funds recived and that they cannot trace any funds. As soon as i send this letter to them and inform them if they not pay out i will report them. Then all of sudden they say that the payment was failed and returned and i should see this in my stripe account again and i can request payout again. So i did, i requested payout of the ""Failed"" payment again. And as soon as i did that, they send me email saying that they are closing my account because unauthorized payment and they will refund customer from my funds! I asked which order was unauthorized because we have delivered all order and we have proof. They did not answer us on this one. Only kept replying to all emails, after reviewing your accounts we decided to refund customer from your funds. I asked again and again which order is unauthorized as all order delivered with proof. They did not answer us. So now they have our funds and will not return to us as they will use the funds to refund some imaginary unauthorized order in which they cannot inform me about. So today i have contacted my lawyer and we have filed a complaint with European financial services.

"I use stripe for my website sales. I had some orders for high value items which I sent to the client.

I was given the option to counter the allegation, I have proof of delivery so I countered their claim. Stripe said I will find out in 6weeks if I get the money back or not. Stripe tried to take more money out of my business bank account too. They offered no resistance and took the money from my Stripe account without me having a chance to defend myself. As a Stripe user I am guilty until proven innocent. I had a client make a £520 order through my website whilst this was going on, I tried to refund them but because Stripe had allowed HSBC to perform a chargeback I now am -£2000 so the refund will not go through. Stripe offered no help at all and kept telling me this was the process. I sent Stripe proof of postage and proof the fraudster received their items.

Stripe has limited scope in dispute matters when a customer goes through their bank. You can read about preventing disputes here: https://stripe.com/docs/disputes/prevention. When a dispute is raised by the cardholder, the card issuer notifies Stripe and automatically deducts the disputed amount as well as a fee for processing the dispute. We then notify you and pass along to you all information related to the dispute that we receive from the issuer via the Dashboard and API. If you choose to fight the dispute by submitting evidence, the issuer will review the evidence you presented and return a win or loss decision within 60-75 days of the evidence due date. This decision from the issuer is final and cannot be challenged by any party. That is to say, if you lose the dispute you cannot appeal this decision, but if you win, the cardholder also does not have the ability to challenge this. You can read more about the dispute process in our Docs here: https://stripe.com/docs/disputes/how-disputes-work. We're happy to help with any issues or questions.

Since I'm using a new business with new documents that are legit and clear, the verification is not going through saying it is not clear and not their format even though it is... I have contacted the support countless times and have to reexplain myself countless times because everytime it is a new person. I've reviewed my documents with them and they stated clearly that my documents are valid but their manual verification team still reject them. It has been 2 weeks since I've been trying to verify and they provide me with false information. Each support member is worse than the other. They don't answer any follow up on email and they delay everything. THEN DONT PUT THE 2 WEEKS RESTRICTION DUE DATE IF YOU WILL DELAY THE VERIFICATION OR ATLEAST POSTPONE IT! Never in my life I have seen a service this bad and this careless. It's like talking to a wall when talking to their support. No results and just a headache with them. I had no choice but to choose a new company to use for my website and now I can't verify my new documents because the system is stuck with the old documents...

Shortly after which I get another email that my account is closed. I complain about this and after several weeks, am told that the account was wrongfully closed. Only several minutes later, support tells me that no it is closed. In March I am told by their customer support that the account was closed on Feb 3rd and the amount held will be released and the payout will be available on Jun 4. After 120 days. On June 5, I ask them that why can't I payout even though that the dashboard says the funds are available to withdraw, they say that my account was closed on 18th feb and I have to wait until 20th June and then they'll see if I should be getting the funds or not. Today I get an email from support after a week of daily emails (asking for details and no response), that they are trying to help and I need to be patient and wait until June 20th. 120 days after a transaction and I still can't get the payout.

"I've been a Stripe customer since 2015. On 4/10/23 I received an email that there was fraudulent activity on my account. I discovered my account had been hacked via fraudulent Connect accounts. The hacker set up a fake business under the name ""Albert Dawkins at Netflix Inc."", and with zero other identifying information was able to charge credit cards AND pay them out instantly to debit cards, also with zero identifying information. When I reached out to Stripe via email and phone for support to get help with someone fraudulently using my account to steal from other people - instead of helping me dispute these charges, Stripe closed my account and started taking money out of my business bank account to refund the fraudulent transactions that they NEVER paid to me in the first place. They continued to attempt to remove money from my bank account even after I asked them for help. After 3 days of back and forth with them, they are telling me that I'm liable for over $70,000 of fraudulent transactions that they allowed to occur on my account, that didn't come from me or my business, and they are completely ignoring the fact that someone has exploited their platform to steal from other people via their customer's accounts, and they are trying to take money from me to pay back fraud they are allowing to happen. It's appalling. I've been a Stripe customer for 8 years with zero issues until now. I'm a small business that doesn't even have $70k of transactions in one quarter, and they are continuing to attempt to debit my bank account and will not help me - they just keep telling me that I am responsible to pay back the money that ""Albert Dawkins of Netflix Inc."" stole from from people and continue to attempt to withdraw money they gave to ""Albert Dawkins"" in the form of instant debit card payouts. If you are using Stripe to process payments for your business, beware. Apparently anyone can just use the Connect feature to hide fraudulent transactions in your account and Stripe will make you pay for it.",2023-04-13T18:47:33.000Z,NA,"April 13, 2023",Shannon Mattern,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,NA,1,"My account was hacked.

So we are a consulting business providing various services for our clients. We are handling payments for one of our clients who does service appointment bookings for AC companies. Two AC companies reported a couple of transactions we ran for our client as not authorized due to some miscommunication on their end. The client reversed the chargeback and Stripe still classified our business as high risk and closed our account not even giving us a few days to get this resolved.

"Absolute Garbage. They will hold your payment for 14 days and possibly more if you aren't in the US.  Guess what they are doing with all that money they are sitting on from these customers..... Must be a good amount of interest paid out to them on your money.  They wont tell you this until after you receive your first payment either.  So in my case, I have to work for free for two weeks before I get the money that was sent with a debit card.  So Stripe literally received the money immediately, but wont let the funds go for my protection. lol.  How are you protecting me by holding money from my customers? So sorry I transferred over to them, now I have to ask my customer that was first to move over to switch back to a legit company.  Oh yeah, by the way, on top of that they take a pretty good chunk of your money from you for their ""Services"" of holding on to thousands of people's money.  Spread the word, they need to get investigated.  Banks can't hold your money for 14 days in the USA.  How can they? *Update* Now I was just hot with another $6 fee that they don't tell you what it is unless you ask. It's marked in their system as if they are paying you, says nothing about what it is, only it's a negative. My favorite part... They don't want to wait 14 days to take that money out.... You know.. for my protection as they say. They won't take it out of the money you have coming, they take their money right away and sit on your money. I can't wait to join the class action suit against them. I hope every DA will go up against this company. Don't expect interest on your money either, while they hold it, they will take a nice chunk of your money and the interest from sitting on it for two weeks. Please contact your State attorney on this shady dual headquarter company from Ireland. They need to be honest. Venmo is free, honest and gets you money immediately. Plus, no fee for the log of what each payment is. There is a reason everybody uses Venmo and Zelle.",2023-04-12T02:19:19.000Z,2023-04-11T00:57:04.000Z,"April 07, 2023",Dave Johnson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Hi Dave!

"Hello, our company Matchmakers Inc has been processing payments through stripe for years ( 6 Years ), they approved our account years ago. Recently we received an offer for a working capital loan, so we applied for it. Two days after we submitted the application we were notified that stripe no longer allows dating sites, however in their terms its state’s adult dating sites, we are a faith-based/Lgbtqiapd+ dating site. Anyways long story short, after years of using them, and with a dispute rate of less than 1%, they have informed us that they are closing our account. Not only have we spent thousands of dollars integrating stripe into our site/pwa, but more than 80% of our customers also pay through stripe. This is a huge blow to our company. We are a federally trademarked business with over 15 years of dating experience. That is extremely shady to offer us a loan and close our account once we apply. Shame on them.

"I took a recommendation based on the fact that the services provided by Stripe were good value! From decades of experience the old adage of if it is cheap there is a reason should have forewarned me! My first transaction went through smoothly back in December. However while taking a much needed break in January I received a substantial order for £5,399.00 through Stripe out of the blue. On a quick investigation I realised that the order was fraudulent and my assistant immediately notified Stripe. Stripe however were unhelpful insisting that the transaction was legitimate and that they were transferring the funds to us. As a result of this we advised Stripe that we wished to cancel the transaction in light of their frivillous approach and they advised that the funds had been sent. I advised my assistant to send an immediate refund of the full transaction value which amounted to £5,399.00. On Saturday 4th February we received an urgent email from the Bank of Canada confirming that the transaction was indeed fraudulent and Stripe agreed with us to place matters on hold pending investigation. We had in the meantime advised Stripe on the Friday that we were refunding the full £5,399.00 and had advised our bank to transfer the funds however recalled this on the Monday. Over the weekend despite matters apparently on hold I received £5,242.23 in my account. I also received two invoices, one relating to the transaction in December and one relating to the fraudulent transaction, despite having advised Stripe of the fraudulent nature of the transaction. I also instructed Stripe that they were entitled to recover £5,242.23 having been the amount received from them in relation to the transaction. They simply ignored this. On Monday however without any further communication they removed £5,622.26 from my account. My bank is now in the process of recovering this. Stripe clearly have absolutely no fraud prevention systems in place. They are not interested in clients who notify them that a transaction is fraudulent and their only focus is on making their fees. In all my decades of dealing with financial institutions this is the worst experience I have ever had and am astonished that they are allowed to operate in the UK. A report is being forwarded to the Financial Conduct Authority. In the meantime Stripe have not responded to emails advising them of the amounts they were authorized to take and have simply ignored these.",2023-02-08T11:16:39.000Z,2023-02-08T12:04:01.000Z,"January 21, 2023",Frank McKenzie,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"We're sorry to hear that you had to deal with a dispute—unfortunately, the card issuer has the final say, and Stripe is not involved in the outcome of the dispute.

"Stripe's chat representative provided excellent customer service to us. Much of what I'd Googled about Stripe stressed that this platform inhabits the high scale of tech, and that non-tech people would likely struggle to establish an account with them. In response to that, we hired a tech expert to help us get started. When Stripe's ""welcome"" message arrived, we were overwhelmed and uncertain how to start using the service. I took advantage of Stripe's ""Chat"" feature, and the Chat rep helped us understand and process our first sale with confidence. Stripe is hugely successful and we're happy to be onboard. To those who manage their ""welcome to Stripe"" material, though, we would suggest this: Provide a split screen ""welcome"" page with two simple titles: /__/ Click here if you're tech-savvy and /__/ Click here if you're tech-challenged so we can better help you get started with Stripe. Then have someone who is NOT tech-savvy write the instructions.

I've made Stripe aware several times and they have refused to take any action whatsoever despite e-mails where they acknowledge the complaint and say they'll investigate.

So I have been a customer of Stripes for 3 years now. Then a customer tries to make a 266.00 order and his payment fails. I explained to the customer its not going through and why after he kept trying for 3 days. So he called his bank and they let the charge go through. An hour later I get an email from Stripe accusing me of stealing money and then that they will be refunding all the money in my account. Which is 12 orders most the customers already have there products. I explained this to stripe said Ild give years of paypal transactions to show I dont get charge backs. They said no to bad were closing you down and returning all there money starting in 14 days. Horrible company stay far away from. There are tons of stories like mine come to find out.

"STAY AWAY Total nightmare, stripe has stolen from me $14,800, all of my earnings that I have made from my start up business. They claimed that there was disputes on my account but in reality there was no complains from anyone, they just wanted the money for themselves. Their message said that my business was a high risk even though there was no complains and everything was going extremely smoothly, I offer a consultation service online so the risk was extremely low. They are fraud and they do not go by any of the rules they have set. They closed down my account and took the money. They accused me of unauthorized charges, since my service is 100% consensual and they got the proofs they need. So what they did, they disabled the contact buttons on my account, refused to reply to me and they kept saying that they are firm on their decision. After that, they ignored me and completely stopped replying. They also went a head and disabled my access to the account from the app. Their costumer service people are beyond horrible and were trained to steal money.  It seems like today stripe decided to steal everyone's money and walk away with it. They are refusing to pay it to me and I will make sure my case goes to the public. If the amount is not given back to me, I will make sure to work with everyone and sue them in court. I will post my case on all media outlets, so they will not fall in this trap, scammers and fraud.

I decided to go for the option to ""call me back"", since Stripe did not provide any telephone number to reach the company.

"STRIPE is the worst company I've dealt with in years.I own a professional photography studio. Its a 2nd generation family business thats been in operation since 1972. The only reason we opened a STRIPE acct. is because we have a website gallery through PIXIESET that allows us to sell photographs online, & we had to open an acct with STRIPE in order to use PIXIESET. We've received several emails from STRIPE saying they could not verify what type of business we are & what products we sell. STRIPE does NOT return phone calls. No one answers the phone.... you get their VM. Immediately following the call, I got a ""CANNED"" email from STRIPE saying they would return my call in 3 minutes, & they listed my phone # that they'd be calling on. 10 minutes later, after never receiving a call from STRIPE, I once again received another ""CANNED"" email saying thet they were ""unable to get ahold of me"".... which was utter BS. I had my phone with me the whole time waiting for their call that never came. My phone never rang, nor was there a voice message from them. Their customer service is all via email & they still have not resoved the issue where they've been holding over 1400.00 from our client transactions beacause they couldnt verify our web address , which i explained from the beginning  that we are currently have a new website designed & that our site was currently down. I sent them all the documention to prove who we are, both from Register.com & GoodGallery web design. I also gave them our business Facebook page & Instagram page information as well. I recently received an email AGAIN asking for our FB & IG information.... which I had already given to them!!!

"I am a new customer of Stripe.  I did all the setups according to their instructions and put live a pricing table that integrated with my website.  The main feature I was looking for was recurring payments, as I sell subscription services.  I did 2 payments to myself to test if I would receive the payout funds in my bank account in a timely manner.  Well, Stripe says that these first payments take 7 business days for security reasons.  In any case, we are 18 business days into this and the payout has NOT arrived in my bank account.  The worst part has been the support, which cannot give me any clear timeframes or answers.  I have had to send Stripe copies of my bank account and even a signed letter from my bank stating that I did NOT receive the funds.  Also, I have had to halt my e-commerce sales because I cannot trust Stripe to make the payouts.  I did spend a good amount of money integrating my website with Stripe.  As a payment provider, Stripe has the responsibility to give the customer adequate support when the payout does NOT arrive at your bank.  I could NOT be more disappointed with such terrible service and disregard for the customer's funds.

"We have been using stripe for a number of years to accept payments on our online store. On 20th November there was an email request from stripe for one of the directors to verify their information and a link to the dashboard. When in the dashboard there was a request for the other director to send verification also which they did, although they didn't receive an email from stripe to request it. On december 4th a customer contacted us to say they couldn't pay by debit card. We noticed that there were no stripe payments for several days (the most important time of the year for our small, independent business) and contacted stripe support immediately. They said that it may take a few more days to verify the documentation that was forwarded and this is why customers couldn't pay. We sent those documents before the deadline, but notwithstanding that stripe stated in the email that should it not be sent by the deadline that 'charges or payouts to your bank account may be paused', not that they would suddenly stop accepting payments without telling us. It is more than disappointing, it has affected our business detrimentally as we had a number of abandoned online orders as a result.",2022-12-05T00:19:58.000Z,2022-12-05T01:36:44.000Z,"December 04, 2022",Jackie AttheCraftyfox,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Hey Jackie, we're incredibly sorry to hear about the issues you've been experiencing with verification here.

"Do you want an overpriced, lying and hard to use payment provider? Let me introduce to you, Stripe. Where do I begin? Well, on the 29/11/22 I opened a stripe account, I opened an account for business use (I will come back to this later). I decided to make an invoice of £5, to myself to try out the platform. So, I paid the £5 invoice by myself to myself via Stripe. A few days later I get an email from Stripe saying that ""We recently identified payments on your Stripe account for **Account name** that don’t appear to have been authorised by the customer, meaning that the owner of the card or bank account didn’t consent to these payments."". Not only did they say that it was an ""unauthorised"" payment, but they said that they will begin refunding payments and no longer taking ANY payments on my account. The ironic thing was that I made the payment to myself, so there couldn't have been an unauthorised payment. Pretty much stripe was lying. So as confused as I was, I decided to contact their support (which turned out to be a nightmare). I send an email to support saying how there was no unauthorised payment as I made the payment to myself and how I can't refund* my ""customer"" (myself), *I tried to get refund back so that I can at least get my money back. I just get robotic answers back where they just copy and paste previously automated messages.  I also tell customer support how I would like to change my business account to an individual account so that my account actions would be removed and that I could resume payments. That never happened. So pretty much stripe took my money and never gave it to me as I am deemed as ""high-risk"" to them which is utter bs.",2022-12-04T16:09:19.000Z,2022-12-04T16:17:23.000Z,"November 29, 2022",Sam,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Hey, we're incredibly sorry the experience has been less than positive here.

"If I could give this company fewer than one star, I would do so. Our account was hacked. A person who donated to our business had his account charged $20K which a hacker then transferred to a debit card they managed to add to our account. Stripe advised us to refund the donor and represented that we would not be held liable as we had tried to contact someone that we could not get into the account, but didn't hear back from them for EIGHT DAYS. During that time, the hack occurred. After we reversed the charge, STRIPE DEDUCTED THE $20K FROM OUR ACCOUNT ANYWAY! Unbelievably, an account rep advised us to charge the donor's card for the amount so we could recoup it. Advice to commit criminal financial fraud?  Further, this donor hadn't given to our business since Oct 2021, so Stripe is keeping our customers' personal information in their system without their knowledge. All in all, this situation has been extremely traumatizing as we are a new, small business and Stripe has been extremely dismissive, condescending, and refuses to take any responsibility for its failure to help us when we repeatedly requested it.

(Our client gave us a bank account number that could only take money in, and not refund it.) When the inevitable conference registration refund needed to happen, Stripe was not able to debit the bank account and consequently shut down all payouts because of this.

"Terrible. We got an approved account. After a few days of operations - they requested an ID verification of the UBO - not an issue - this was done. Right after the verification was completed - we have got an email that our account is blocked because our absolutely transparent business (sales of digital materials - courses) and claimed that it is not eligible and high risk. We have provided the documents proving that we have everything handles. We send clients emails informing them about the purchase they made, we have customer support which handles any inbound concerns or questions. We have all of the supporting documentation, yet Stripe went ahead with the decision to refund every client who has bought the online course. When the client gets a refund - he/she normally losese an access to the purchased materials as stated in our T&C. Stripe is making a brand damage to our company that has started in August. I will do the same to them by writing this beautiful review of their misleading practices. First of all I checked whether my business is not restricted and proceeded with account opening - everythung was smooth at first until they all of a sudden decided to flag the business as high risk since payments were not made through 3DS channel - which is not even our fault. I won't recommend this company to any single soul if they are just starting a business - they can let you down pretty quick without giving you a single idea what is their concern. Please stay away of this company as they seems to only work with large brands and companies with 100% proven operatons. This is not for those who want to start slow and steady and to be sure your account won't get blocked in the middle of the day.",2022-11-29T15:44:03.000Z,2022-11-29T16:41:45.000Z,"November 29, 2022",Dzhuliya Dobrekova,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Hi there —we're awfully sorry to hear your experience has been less than positive.

"we have worked with stripe for years. then when covid came in we stopped for a while. They have been receiving our clients' payments threw fresh books to only ask us to verify a website. after all the coding for subscription payments they come back and say we cannot have an account with them. so, they have about 900.00 om hold for services that were rendered and. every time i ask for a refund they keep spinning me. It's not even listed in our account as them having the money they have been collecting money for 8 months. Before you do business with them read the reviews and check with other companies. these people don't even answer the phone just  bot messages mostly Update Review. I guess your company use bots to answer reviews as well. When I go to the BBB for resolutions I'll be sure to post the very email that was sent to me this morning from your company showing that your not telling the truth. I will also show the transactions that was sent to your company. Freshbooks would be an accessory  with you. Surley they don't practice the same decit that stripe is doing if they're smart the the would drop you as fast as they can. Your company is hurting small business by holding their funds. No need to respond back save it for the Better Business Bureau. The more reviews the more aware people will be you guys appear to have no shame. It will catch up to you. The bottom line I want my money back for services rendered. I'm gonna personally ask freshbooks to remove your services cause they don't do business like the way your doing it stripe.   it appears that who reads this review for strip you don't have no shame. Eventually it will catch up to the whole corporate structure of Strip.

"Stripe stopped my deposits without emailing me to verify my domain.  Once I noticed the deposits were not in my account I contacted them and successfully verified my domain.  The deposits have not resumed and I call them daily yet they keep giving me the same run around, that someone needs to manually review the account.  The rep I spoke with already confirmed that the domain was verified.  I asked to speak to a manager and they would not let me.  I understand as a business they need to verify merchants for the safety of the industry, but I have verified myself and they are still holding my deposits.  I have done nothing wrong and maintained a stand up account.  All of my clients orders are fulfilled yet they are not releasing deposits.  If I am doing stand up business with my clients Stripe should do the same with me as a merchant.  The most frustrating part is they keep telling me 24 hours.  It has been almost two weeks since they have held my deposits.  I need some help please!

"Stripe is a terrible company with zero accountability. If you’re a business considering Stripe as a payment solution, I urge you to think twice. A customer accidentally reported her credit card payment through Stripe as fraudulent because she lost her credit after using it to make the payment. Stripe charged me a hefty administrative fee (~$25) for a small transaction of $39 on top of refunding the total charge to the customer. Even when provided with written proof from the customer and proof of receipt of the product, Stripe insists that they cannot do anything to rectify the situation and my business has to bear the loss for this loophole that they are responsible for. The situation would be a lot worse if the transaction amount were bigger.

We love Stripe we have been with them for many years the only issue we have is that it seems they make their currency exchange accounting very vague. For instance our gross income vs our net income always had a large difference (which started to become strange to us over time). After doing research to understand the discrepancies we realized we are being charged based on currency exchanges but it’s basically an invisible number and there is not much flexibility with different currencies to reduce this cost. All of this is understandable but they do not disclose this to you so you have to reverse engineer the numbers to really see how much you’re loosing to currency exchange. We think that’s kind of sketchy this amount really should be itemized as currency charges for the month so that we have a clear understanding of what it is costing us. The other issue is that they slow down your payouts which slows down your cash flow. I guess this is for their own security but as a small business having to wait for funds to clear or pay extra for your funds is a little annoying to deal with. We compensated for this but it would be nice to be able to build a relationship with Stripe overtime that would speed up your payouts without additional cost. Other than those two sticking points Stripe has been great to us.,2022-11-10T16:42:09.000Z,2022-11-10T23:08:03.289Z,"November 10, 2022",customer,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Hey there, thanks for writing in with this valuable feedback.

We did not use it integrally as we had zoho. After waiting to get logged in we were told that because we did not have a website they could not verify us. I then proceeded to get unlocked by emailing (there is not one phone number). They unlocked my account. I thought I was back in business. We weren't they needed to verify and asked us to provide documentation regarding our ID, business articles and information about what we did. I provided articles, passport, and a whole business write up regarding what we did. We are a simple cleaning company that was allowed to use this service and pay the company good money to do so. In a matter of weeks they shut down the system, and our business processes of collecting invoices. They now hold 3400 dollars of our money and want a valid website to verify. I guess passport and articles don't matter. We don't need a website at the moment. Stripe doesn't care. They only close the online chats out and close our tickets when we don't answer. They don't even call when there is this type of issue. I don't see it going to far as a company. As of current I am still demanding they close out our account and give our invoice dollars back as we have employees to pay. This really sucked. 2 employees quit as they thought stripes inadequate company processes were our own. Due to this we lost 2 contracts totalling roughly 30k per year. I am out money and time because of this convenience they tout. They are not the best company and we will look for another that maybe handles customer service and issues better, and that doesn't keep our money for over 2 months now.",2022-11-09T06:03:44.000Z,2022-11-09T15:40:53.122Z,"November 01, 2022",Prime Porter Inc.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Hi there—we're sorry to hear you've had a bad experience, this is not our intention nor is it the typical way this plays out.

Stripe is so much better than paypal. This is a generalized review. The percentage rate is much cheaper. They don't play games with my money. They don't hold your payments. If someone files a chargeback they take the funds out of your bank acct until the issue is resolved. They are just a pretty straight forward company. They even have invoices and subscriptions you can set up for your clients. This is very useful if you need to set up a payment plan and the invoice automatically debits the funds according to the dates you set for payments. Stripe is very unproblematic and I like them for this very reason. They do all of my accounting for me which makes it easy come tax time. You can see how much money you have made. The sales volume from month to month. They make it very simple for their customers.

Stripe clearly states their fees, payout schedules & whatever else complaint I'm reading about them. Nobody seems to say how amazing their uptime is, low latency, fraud protection (if you know how to utilize the system). Stripe offers everything to its devs and customers, you just need to know how to use their systems. Yes, it works out of the box but if you want to be protected against fraud for example, then you need rules setup.

"As a small business I originally signed up to the usual card payment suppliers. After 2 years of high costs I reviewed and found STRIPE offered much more reasonable rates.

With STRIPE downloaded to my accounts package it just makes life a bit easier, shows up straight away and you can see from the outset the charges taken. No more end of month invoices. No more not seeing if payment has not been cleared.

"What a terrible experience! After days of jumping through hoops to validate an address on my driving license, I finally gave up. Thanks to their incompetence, my volunteer humanitarian aid organization in Ukraine, which has been running since July 2022, has now had all payments suspended because 'they don't know where I live'. I uploaded my driving license, passport, valid connected bank accounts, everything but the kitchen sink.

We are a non profit childrens gymnastics club who uses class for kids and stripe is the payment provider. Stripe has placed an unreasonable reserve on our account but are refusing to answer why. We are very concerned with this lack of explaination and have no choice but to consult the FCA as we Cannot get an answer from then as to why. Very underhand and they are effectively stealing from a charity. I am very unhappy with their lack of information and explaination as to why. We will be moving back to paying at the gym as we no longer have faith in stripe handling our money. We are shocked and feel we are being unfairly deemed as high risk without any explaination.

"The front end of your system is excellent - customers like the system for ordering tickets - it is easy and user friendly.  The back end needs a lot of help.  We are a concert presenter and have as many as five concerts on sale at a time.  When we get a deposit to our bank account, it gives very minimal information about how many tickets were sold to each event and the cost less the merchant fee - it also gives us no information about contributions included in the sale.  We use another system to give us the detail, but it does not give us the information by deposit - so, we have had to tediously go between the two systems to get the information we need to post to each concert and contributions.

I contacted the buyer through Bonanza and they acknowledged they made the purchase, asked us to send them a new invoice. That's not how it works with stripe. We can't invoice them again, plus Bonanza is keeping their free and stripe is charging a dispute fee. All this on a transaction that the customer admits to making.

"Avoid using Stripe at any cost. They all of a sudden put a hold on my account holding of over £10k for 120 days for any disputes or refunds. Meanwhile, I had to issue two refunds but was told they couldn’t allow me access to my account and that the account was on hold for 120 days. Since I was unable to refund the customer they opened a chargeback for the full value of the order, not just the item that was returned. So I contacted Stripe and about this and the reply was that the account was put on hold for 120 days. I keep emailing them for an explanation and today I received an email telling me that the hold they have will be extended for another 120 days!

"AVOID STRIPE AT ALL COSTS OR RISK LOSING ALL YOUR MONEY! Stripe has terms of service that say they can keep your money without cause or warning, I did not know this until it was too late, don't let this happen to you!  I lost $30K, don't make the same mistake I did.  This little hidden statement in their terms means they can withhold all of your money and freeze your account WITHOUT justification, and I had no idea they could do this. So if their automated AI picks up something that it thinks matches this ruleset it auto freeze and there is nothing you can do to unfreeze because they do not have real humans at the helm.    They used this loophole to steal $30,000 of my money. Please DO NOT FALL VICTIM TO THEM AS DID.   Understand that they are 100% automated software platform with little human oversight, do your homework before you invest your business into them as they have 100% power of all your cash flow.   The only humans that work for them are overseas people who do not speak English very well or understand anything, which means be prepared for nothing but canned copy and pasted answers and no real actaul research or help.  Instead, they are trained to copy and paste the exact same answer. So they steal your money by freezing your account and then don't answer you or help; instead, they just copy and paste the exact text out of their desk system, in fact it every well could be a AI bot dong all of their CS and you would have no idea.  HERE IS MY STORY...  I will be happy to go on podcasts, TV Show, Radio Show, or any program to spread the word about them, so others do not fall victim as I have.   HERE IS MY -STORY...  I have been in business for 20 years; I use Freshbooks.com to process around 2 million a year in credit card charges a year.   We added a stripe to our software to automate our billing, We started to migrate our customers over and did 3 customers, but the charges appeared as our legal name. on the bank statement, not the DBA.   This confused one of the customers because they did not know our legal name so they issued a  chargeback and they got their oney back. I noticed it, called the customer, and explained that that's our legal name. They apologized and offered to replay their invoice of $27,000.   When they did but then stripe never deposited the money. When I asked it, they kept telling me my account was frozen and under view, and i had to w 2 days. Well, 3 days passed no answer, after 15 emails and 2 months, they kept saying my account was in review.   I sent them a signed contract from the customer, emails from the customer saying the mistake they made, links to phone calls of MP3 files of me talking to the customer about the issue and the customer apologizing,  DBA and articles of incorporation. But because this was 30% of all my customers since I only moved three over, they flagged my account, said it was ""high risk,"" and refused to release my funds. I asked if they could cancel my account and return all the money to the customers because they would issue me a check. Instead, they just kept saying they ""merged my tickets for better communication"" because their customer service people did not understand or even begin to care about the problem.   Every email would go to a different person, and every person would merge into another account no one would ever ever get back to me. Then after emailing every day I get a templated email saying they are going to shut down my account because it is high risk and I will get my funds in Jan 18th of 2023 (6 months later), with an explanation or reason. No one will call me, or email me, or talk t me. They drove me to the point of me typing in all caps, cursing at them over email and losing my cool. They do not care. They just ignored me and kept my $30,000. I have no idea if they will really even return my money in Jan.  At this point I am now forced to try and seek legal action against them.   I beg you, DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM...  they will not help you. If I had continued to move all my business to them, they would have 100% destroyed my business of 20 years, and I would have lost everything and my 15 employees would all be fired because I would not have any cash flow.    There is a customer via phone.. all they. have an answering service in a 3rd party call center that is located overseas.

"Absolutely awful way to accept payments. I decided to allow Stripe payments on my Facebook Marketplace listings because what could go wrong, right? Wrong. I spent ages going through the identity process and sign up for this service and sold my first item which was paid via Stripe's 'secure' payments, the postage was handled by Facebook and I thought 'hey, this doesn't seem so bad and is actually like PayPal'.... Nope, some weeks later, I get a charge back notification from Stripe because the card holder claims that that the transaction wasn't authorised by them.

Expected my first payout on Friday September 2nd. It didn't arrive. Payment was for quite a large sum of money. Spoke with Stripe representative who didn't have a clue what was going on and told me in 24 hours the matter would be resolved. The matter was that Stripe were trying to pay out to my 16 digit USD account number. Because I'm currently located in Poland - Stripe Poland were DELETING 2 of those digits (they call it 'stripping out 2 digits') which the receiving bank - Transferwise needed to receive the payout successfully. So it's now in a constant circle of payout leaves Stripe and tries to go to the receiving bank (receiving bank can't receive it as the account number details - 16 digits - don't match up). Then after 5 days money comes back and because Stripe can't update the account number successfully - the money keeps getting sent to the wrong account number. Unbelievable but true. Now I have to proceed with legal action against - Stripe Ireland or Stripe Poland or maybe just Stripe?  Would not recommend these people as far as you could throw them. I've spoken to SIX representatives so far who really do not seem to know what they're doing.,2022-09-07T17:32:14.000Z,2022-09-07T18:43:09.227Z,"September 07, 2022",Paul Mc Keown,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Hi Paul—we're sorry to hear about this frustrating experience.

"Omg 😳 worst payment processing company I’ve ever had. I signed up for stripe though Monzo and started to send payment links to my customers- a week late they’ve frozen my account and refunded all the payments to my customers even though i had invoices signed by my customers. At point they told me they can’t support my business and  that will close also.

"Stripe is the best payment system that others should follow. I have only been working with Stripe for a few months, but during this time I have already managed to convince myself of the high professionalism of their support. At any time of the day or night, you can contact the support service via online chat and they will help you at the highest level - you will not be endlessly redirected to another technical support agent, as is usually the case with other stupid support services. For me, Stripe has become an example of who to look up to. Separately, I would like to note the speed of the validation process for your business - you just fill out all the necessary forms and you're done, you can start accepting payments. In addition, if in the process you are asked to undergo additional verification or provide some additional documents, then you will be sure that they will be considered immediately after you provide them, and not like it is with others - where you are answered by a stupid support agent once a week and your documents are checked for weeks or months. I have never seen such a high level of professionalism.

"Stripe is a lifesaver in terms of ease of use for our digital products and services. We integrate it with Kajabi, and with a direct native integration, collecting credit card payments couldn't be easier! The one frustration I have is if we need to refund something for any reason, there are absolutely no exceptions that I've found where Stripe is also willing to refund their fees. Normally, this is fine. But we've had 2 instances where this was really detrimental. We have a high-ticket service with multiple payment options. A client accidentally paid in full, and needed to be refunded and placed on a payment plan. Without having the fees refunded, we'd incur double the fees for the same clients' payments, and Stripe would NOT refund the fees for the original purchase.

"Stripe is terrible.  I added stripe as a payment option for my AAU track club and non-profit because of funding opportunities from partnering agencies and organizations.  It has been nothing but difficulties and headaches.  I've had to ""prove"" that I'm an actual organization multiple times and they withhold payments and balances until verification. Yet, while withholding my funds, they've collected their fees.  This slowed my ability to purchase uniforms-my kids had to run in their own top/bottoms for almost 3 weeks-pay for travel, and register for competitions.   Stripe finally released the funds only to withhold them again as I was preparing for the team to travel to Jr. Olympics.  Stripe is still currently withholding money from my organization (minus their fees) until I ""verify"" that the money is going to a business account despite uploading our bank documents multiple times and having already processed numerous transactions to the same account that I had to verify to open the account.

"Stripe has been processing payments for our business for about 6 years or so now.  We have come to know this is a very trustworthy , reliable company and security has never been a question for us or our clients and that is important . We were offered a stripe capital loan (I believe is what it was called)  and after we thought about it a little bit it just makes more sense than a bank or other type of financing route .  We started filling out some very basic questions and within no time at all we had funds available . It's seriously the most simple , straightforward process with very clear outline as to how it's going to work for repayment , the total cost of the loan etc . Right up front and no hidden goofy fees , no lengthy thousand question forms to fill out that require jumping through hoops and repaying is so easy it's just a percentage off the payments you receive and quite honestly it's barely noticable and that is it . Really! Just as good as a person could ask for in terms of business loans or other options I know of and really helpful if business is slow , or maybe you need to get some more equipment like we did  or repair things etc  . We're a lawn and landscape service and the overhead is unreal , the cost to keep equipment in good shape and trucks  it just never ends and we have found ourselves in need of a little help many times .

I called the manufacturer to place the order on Monday, May 30th 2022. The sales representative said 75% of the order is in stock and 25% is on backorder until the end of July. I called the customer back to let him know and he said that would be no problem so I proceeded with placing his full order. The furniture was fully paid for and the customer was aware that 75% was scheduled to be delivered to our store on June 9, 2022. We received the delivery from the manufacturer on June 9th.

"I received my review email from Stripe, I believe it’s natural as a small business owner to get anxiety about the review. Our small business as many others faced hardship when Covid hit our Country. We lost many accounts along with closing our online business, ONLY utilizing local sales as our primary source of income. The Stripe review team did not require but highly favored our business going back online, revamping our website and social presence. While in the beginning I admit I was concerned because of the additional work it may involve in the time frame I had with my own scheduling. To my surprise, we instantly had new business request coming in, once we started our social pages again, we immediately began getting work estimate request as well. Our previous clients we’re waiting to see us again. I wrote the kind team at Stripe thanking them for reviewing our business and urging us to get our online presence back up and running. If it was not for the review and high recommendation, we will still be stuck in the same local circle, which that is wonderful, but the push gave us more revenue instantly and new clients. I rate Stripe as the BEST for any business, small or large, they have solutions for every business. Just go to the website and look around at all the new tools available, call the customer service team, talk with them about your business needs, trust the process, because they will not lead you wrong.

"I've been a Stripe user for almost a decade, imo the experience is going downhill.  The simple and ""just works"" API is getting more and more complicated and complex with changes that don't really need to be changes, feature bloat, etc.  The killer was the decision to not refund user issued refunds - especially during covid.  That crushed many small businesses and destroyed any goodwill and loyalty I had to Stripe.  I've sent millions of dollars in transaction volume through you guys via clients, recommends, and my own apps.  So, I'm a little salty about the decline of what was one of the very best tech products ever created.

"Having suffered from a recent card testing attack, I had the opportunity to engage Stripe support.  I learned a lot in the experience.  I detected the incident before Stripe and engaged them and received in response boilerplate instructions on mitigating such incidents.  I contacted Stripe after shutting down the exploited WooCommerce product expecting assistance with shutting down the two successfully tested credit cards.  I discovered this responsibility was all on me through the refund process with a fraud tag.  I also thought I was secure after shutting down one product and quickly implementing email verification, however the attack returned with vengeance resulting in 50 successful testings and prompting a complete shutdown of site commerce.  Refunds resulted in a negative balance as Stripe gets to keep its fees even on fraudulent transactions.  Switching to my staging site I was able to securely implement email verification, transfer to live, and put the attacks to bed for now (3 weeks).  To be fair, Stripe was very responsive, and their information was helpful, however I was disappointed with the absence  of indemnification which I assumed was part of our agreement.  Fortunately the cost of the lesson was minimal.",2022-08-11T21:27:19.000Z,2022-08-11T18:44:25.723Z,"August 11, 2022",Mark D,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Hey Mark, we're incredibly sorry to hear about your experience with using our services and our support in general.

"I thought stripe was a good way to pay when using facebook marketplace, but i soon realised why all the bad reviews were coming in on this website. The person who bought my item was obviously a fraud artist, with their facebook profile being suspicious, the name on the profile and delivery name didnt match up, and their account was deleted after a few months. I did not realise this until my purchase was complete, however. I got an email from stripe saying that a fraud case had been started, they were going to take the money back and include a fee until it was resolved. The customer had used many different cards, neither of which worked. How this is my issue and not the customers, i’m not sure. I rang customer service and they told me all the proof I needed to submit, which I did, and was told I was likely to win. Cut to a few months later, I receive an email stating that the bank has rejected my case and that I will not be getting my money back.

"We use the export csv sheet from your site to make a detailed deposit report for our record keeping. Your spreadsheet is almost useless to us in that hardly any addresses appear.

You have a column for the gross amounts and for the fee amounts but not for the net amount. This data is important to us. The long codes are meaningless to us.

"Stripe will ask you for evidence when people claim for their money back after using and benefiting from your services. Regardless of how accurate your supporting documents are, Stripe will let the cardholder institution have the last word, and close the case immediately without giving you an opportunity to appeal. Additionally, if you ever get in touch with someone from customer service from any of the parties involved, they’ll ask you to contact the opposite party; as a result, nobody can be held accountable when this occurs and the service you provided won’t be compensated despite supporting evidence and/or signed agreement you and your client had.

All my sales are generated from our online website. So July 14th this got resolved but we had to shut down our company send employees home until they could get us up and running.

"I set up a fundraiser on Fundly. To show support for my own cause and build credibility with donors, I donated $1,000 to my own fundraiser. Suddenly, Stripe disables my payment account and I can no longer accept donations. They gave me no warning and no explanation. After dozens of emails and over a week, they responded that ""my business"" (I am an individual) has an elevated risk of dispute charges. They refunded all of my donors' payments, except for my own $1,000 donation for some reason. Again, after dozens of emails, they gave me no explanation other than above. They originally told me they would hold my money for 5-7 days. That came and went and after more emails, they responded they are holding my money now for 120 days. It is absolute insanity and wreaks of theft, fraud, and extortion. They already ruined my reputation with my friends and family regarding my cause, and now they're holding $1,000 of my own hard-earned money. DO NOT USE FUNDLY and DO NOT TRUST STRIPE.

While I love the platform - the payments are slow. They offer a 3 business day payout after you have been with them for a while. But I have yet to see that happen.

Really good system to use via my website. App is easy to use and can see how much is due to be transferred and when.

Stripe works well for our business. The payments are easy to process for our customers and arrive in our bank in a few days. I do wish the fees were not deducted before the money is deposited in our bank account.

Quickbooks Payments deducts the fee as a separate item from the payment being deposited in our account. The job scheduling app we have uses Stripe so it works.

I think stripe is cool but honestly the software is not clear and concise at all. You constantly have to call and get help with your customer service department. They outsource these calls to different countries so you’ll be lucky if you get someone on the phone that actually is able to help you properly. I love everyone no matter what color they are so please don’t take this the wrong way when I say this. I have terrible ADHD and it’s really hard for me to understand the accents of some of these people that they outsource these phone calls to. The people sound like they’re just rolling out of bed and that they really don’t even want to be bothered. Honestly I never fully understand what they’re even explaining to me. It’s a combination of stripes software not being clear and concise or user-friendly and a combination of the fact that they outsource these calls to people in different countries.  I never feel like I fully know what’s going on with my Stripe account. This is really sad. If I could find another company that does payments with more clear and concise software I will absolutely leave Stripe in a heartbeat . Since I’ve had stripe for years they’ve done nothing to try to make the software better. It’s exhausting to even be a part of stripe.,2022-07-12T14:59:45.000Z,2022-07-12T15:13:25.057Z,"July 12, 2022",Sada Marshall,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Hey there, we're incredibly sorry the experience has been less than positive here.

"WARNING Do not use Stripe!! We sold an Xbox to a buyer who paid through stripe. Item was sent the same day tracked and after day 4 the buyer was still not in to receive it. They then messaged me to ask if the item could be directed to his sister which I refused to do so he lodged a fraud claim against me. Stripe blocked my access despite me proving who I was and when I challenged the buyer he said he wasn’t a fraud. The next day hey presto item received. I proved the item went tracked, all conversations and proof of delivery but the buyers bank found in his favour so I’m now out of pocket to the tune of £200 and without the item. I’m now in a position where I’m having to get a solicitor and the financial ombudsman involved as well as the police. Stripe at no point stepped in to look logically at the case and think yeah item received so how could it be fraudulent. Buyers are not vetted either only the seller is requested to prove who they are.

"DREADFUL DO NOT USE FOR ANYTHING. Being offered this company via Facebook as a alternative to PayPal (because you can’t use PayPal or anyone else) for Facebook Marketplace. They offer no clarity on who is paying you, so you have to use the details you receive from Facebook chat…. Basically “a buyer” was able to access someone else’s account ON STRIPE and used there account to purchase an item from me!! Now STRIPE are telling me that’s it’s my responsibility and I have to pay the monies back, PLUS additional fees because of there Lapses in addressing fraud and fraudsters accessing accounts! As I was a new user of STRIPE they advised they would sit on my funds for almost 10 working days to ensure the transaction was agreed. Then they paid the funds into my account….Bang on the 11th day the transaction was fraudulent according to STRIPE and they wanted all this evidence from me and they wanted to charge for the fact the transaction was fraudulent.

"I used to feel more secure with Stripe, but lately I've been feeling very uneasy using their service. Seems there are always issues with the site or the app. I started using them because they now have Instant Payout (payments can be sent to your bank instantly for an additional 1%) but then a few months ago, they suddenly stopped allowing you to switch payment cards to send payments to your account - sneaky and shady too, they didn't give anyone any warning first, so one weekend, I had to wait 5-6 days to get my ""instant"" payout!! That's because they don't allow more than 1 payment card at a time and when you switch cards, it takes a few days to be activated and since I split my payments into 2 different banks, I used to always swap the card and send the rest all at the same time... So I ended up having to contact them and they eventually fixed my account so I didn't have to wait like that, but it was a real shock how they made such a sudden change with no warning. And ever since then I've felt like I lost confidence in their service, you never know when they might change something that's extremely important, on a dime with no warning...",2022-06-29T20:14:01.000Z,2022-06-30T04:21:32.206Z,"June 29, 2022",Jaden M,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Hi Jaden, thanks for sharing this feedback with us.

"Customer Service & Fraud detection was Unsatisfactory. In Oct 2021, there was an error that a customer made and they added too many zeros to the amount they were trying to process in our online payment system. We refunded them the full amount  as it has not reached our bank yet and we thought it was not fully processed. Stripe kept the fee even though the amount processed never reached our bank account. But it was deemed as a successful transaction. We were left to incur the whole fee amount. We asked to speak to a manager multiple times and we were put through numerous levels of customer service. The API failed to detect a large amount that should never have been put through so fraud detection also fell short. One week later, a marketing email was sent to us letting us know that there is now a fraud protection plan if we decide to sign up.

"I have never even heard of stripe until 2 months ago. A customer made a mistake and for some reason though I have a account with stripe and made the payment before asking me. And stripe accepted the payment. How can a company accept a payment to a account that doesn't even exist?. After I informed my customer that I don't use stripe they tried getting a refund but had a difficult time. Next I received a email from stripe saying they have my money and I just need to open an account with them to receive my money. Otherwise my customer would have to wait over a week to get a refund. I did not want my customer to get stuck dealing with stripe to get their money back, I decided what the heck I will just open an account with them. I thought it was like PayPal or cashapp. So I attempted to open a account with them. Opening an account with them to receive my money was a ridiculous process, first they wouldn't release my funds unless I had a business website which I don't because I am a contractor and don't need one. I don't sell products online I remodel homes and my clientele comes from word of mouth. Second reason they said they couldn't give me my funds was because I don't have a tax id number which by law if I my business is a sole proprietorship I can use my ssn instead. They wouldn't accept that. So I called their customer service and said I want the money refunded to customer and I don't want to open an account with them anymore because they are making it impossible for me. I thought that was done and over with until couple days they pulled a high fee from my bank account for a transaction that I didn't even receive my money from. How can company accept payment when the receiving party doesn't even have a account with them? That's ridiculous. Anyways I called stripe to get a refund for that ""transaction"" where I didn't even receive money because of stripes impossible rules. They denied me. Anyways I forgot this whole thing and yesterday I find out my bank card has been hacked and unauthorized transactions were made. I call my bank and start investigating and my bank tells me that the service merchant behind these fraudulent transaction was STRIPE. So either my info somehow got leaked from them or they are doing something shady. Anyways I just wanted to get paid for a job I did and stripe made my life very difficult when I tried working with them to open a account but they make it almost impossible to open a account unless you meet their ridiculous demands.

"Stripe paused payouts to my bank account 2 weeks ago because my website was not accurately listed with them.  It was, I only have 1 website, and it's listed accurately. Since I've pointed that out to them and they keep telling me the review is complete, and they affirm that I've done everything on my end and I should hear back within 24 to 48 hours.  Well, every day I reach back out and they can not seem to give me an answer as to why the pause has not been lifted.  I am a US-based corp. with an EIN and not in a restricted business with a verified phone and have done everything they've asked.  If they would provide real answers to me with real reasons why the pause is still active we could help resolve this challenge, instead, zero progress has been made in 2 weeks and payouts to my bank are still paused for absolutely no reason.  Each of the 6 customer support reps I've spoken with is not able to provide a solution or any options for any support.  Reject my account, lift the pause or give me direction on how I can help.  Just leaving a client in limbo for 2 weeks is unacceptable.  For this reason, I give 1 star.

"We have used Stripe for over a year to manage payments for Art Deco HouseUK, a high end self catering property. The tool is good for sending out invoices and receiving payments with helpful tools for creating invoices. The problem we have however, if you want to create pages for payments, use QR codes for people to pay directly for items and so on, you need to have developer skills. We do not, so reluctantly for such payments we use a competitor's platform when we would rather have used Stripe. So for example, we have an honesty bar, guests scan a QR code to open a page and then use free text to put in what they bought and the price they are paying which they got from the price tag on the bottle. There is no way we could ever facilitate this in Stripe. But, if all you want it a reliable tool to send out invoices, collect payments etc, STRIPE if great, although not exactly intuitive, unless you have developer and finance skills.",2022-06-23T20:44:28.000Z,2022-06-24T04:14:43.796Z,"June 23, 2022",Art Deco HouseUK (Laurence),Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Thanks for sharing your experience, Laurence!

"The worst customer service I have ever dealt with! As a business, I always make it a point ensure that my customers are satisfied. Instead, Stripe uses a customer service provider which simply does not have the tools to service its customers. They tell you that they can make no exceptions to any policy (even if it is a very valid reason) and cannot connect you with a manager because their system will simply not allow them to transfer your call. When they told me that a Supervisor or “support manager” would reach out to call me, I got an email in which they said “hey sorry I tried to call you twice but you missed the call!” They never actually called me! And I have proof to back that claim up. I waited by the phone for 24+ hours for the call. This is so unprofessional of them.

Really happy digging deeper in to Stripe's developer tools and new features.  The payment links are especially great to cut time-to-market and improve my flexibility offering payment in a handful of client touchpoints.  Definitely expect to be successful with these integrations.  Kudos on a job very well done.

After I spoke with some and was able to work through the issues the service was great and the responsiveness welcomed. My largest problem was finding the way to speak with someone through the website. The 3 min number was hidden under layers of tabs.

"We started using stripe and accepted our first payment on March 21, 2022. We were so excited at the convenience this would bring our small business only to now feel hostage to the company. We have still not received a  single payout with very little explanation as to why and poor communication.  We understood that the first payout could take up to 14 days but we are now over 2 months. We have a different support person calling and emailing us with the same response “we apologize for any inconvenience. Your case is being reviewed by a specialist and we will be in touch with you.”  No follow-up, no explanation and no action and never does a “specialist” call us (despite several request) to explain anything. Our livelihood is tied up in this company and we have no way to access our funds.

Stripe locked my money and  is refusing to reply to emails and blocks communication via their live chat. Used Stripe for about a month.  They upgraded me to faster payouts and a few days later suddenly banned me for no reason. By no reason I mean they said there were unauthorized charges made to the customer which is simply not true. I would avoid these thieves at all costs. No better than Paypal and THAT is a very very low bar. ,2022-06-08T20:45:47.000Z,2022-05-26T02:08:01.156Z,"May 25, 2022",mick jameson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Hi Mick!
